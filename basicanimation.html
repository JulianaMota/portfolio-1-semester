            <h2>Simple Animation</h2>
            <div class="responsive-text">

                <p>The assignment was to create a simple animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was individual and it was required to create an animation that could jump, move, shine, fade, talk and fall down. I used 4 characters from the animation movie "My Neighbor Totoro" directed by Hayao Miyazaki to create a simple and funny animation.</p>

            <h2>The Mysterious Forest</h2>
            <div class="responsive-text">

                <p>The assignment was to create a story that could be future used in an animation. This project had to be made following one of the styles given by the teacher. So I have created a story based on Limbo style and through that, I have made a drama and suspense animation with a nine-tails fox and a rabbit. For making this project I have worked with style tile, story creation, message, genre, storyboard, narrative curve, dramaturgic elements, character sheet/worksheet, background conception and a sprite sheet - who will show a small animation of one scene from the story. </p>

                <p>The assignment consisted of using a scene from a story to create an animation with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For this project was required to use events, sounds and if statements. So together with my colleague, we have used the story of the turtle and the rabbit to create this animation and making a user interaction where he could choose the ending.</p>

            <h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2>
            <div class="responsive-text">

                <p>The assignment consisted of creating an animation using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This project was a 6 member group work where we had to use a passage of a movie/animation with a given style and music by the teachers. Our given style was surrealism and a music Gods Made Love by Jimi Hendrix. So through this, we have decided to use the first scenes of the story Alice in Wonderland and create an animation with user interaction. The background and characters were made with surrealistic features and we tried to add some elements to make it more appealing to young adults since they were our target audience.</p>
